    <h1 class="text-stile">Mountains</h1>
    <p class="text-stile">A mountain is a large landform that rises above the surrounding land in a limited area, usually in the form of a peak.
       A mountain is generally considered to be steeper than a hill. 
       Mountains are formed through tectonic forces or volcanism. 
       These forces can locally raise the surface of the earth. 
       Mountains erode slowly through the action of rivers, weather conditions, and glaciers.
       A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in huge mountain ranges.</p>

    <p>High elevations on mountains produce colder climates than at sea level.
       These colder climates strongly affect the ecosystems of mountains: different elevations have different plants and animals. 
       Because of the less hospitable terrain and climate, 
       mountains tend to be used less for agriculture and more for resource extraction and recreation, 
       such as mountain climbing and skiing.</p>

    <p>The highest mountain on Earth is Mount Everest in the Himalayas of Asia, whose summit is 8,850 m (29,035 ft) above mean sea level. 
      The highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System is Olympus Mons on Mars at 21,171 m (69,459 ft).</p>

      <h2>Volcanoes</h2>
      <p>Volcanoes are formed when a plate is pushed below another plate, or at a mid-ocean ridge or hotspot.At a depth of around 100 km, melting occurs in rock above the slab (due to the addition of water), and forms magma that reaches the surface. When the magma reaches the surface, it often builds a volcanic mountain, such as a shield volcano or a stratovolcano.:194 Examples of volcanoes include Mount Fuji in Japan and Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines.
       The magma does not have to reach the surface in order to create a mountain: magma that solidifies below ground can still form dome mountains, such as Navajo Mountain in the US.

      <h2>Fold mountains</h2>
      <p>Fold mountains occur when two plates collide: shortening occurs along thrust faults and the crust is overthickened.
         Since the less dense continental crust "floats" on the denser mantle rocks beneath, the weight of any crustal material forced upward to form hills, plateaus or mountains must be balanced by the buoyancy force of a much greater volume forced downward into the mantle. 
         Thus the continental crust is normally much thicker under mountains, compared to lower lying areas.
         Rock can fold either symmetrically or asymmetrically. The upfolds are anticlines and the downfolds are synclines:
         in asymmetric folding there may also be recumbent and overturned folds. 
         The Balkan Mountains and the Jura Mountains are examples of fold mountains.</p>

      <h2>Block mountains</h2>
      <p>Block mountains are caused by faults in the crust: a plane where rocks have moved past each other. 
         When rocks on one side of a fault rise relative to the other, it can form a mountain.
         The uplifted blocks are block mountains or horsts. The intervening dropped blocks are termed graben: these can be small or form extensive rift valley systems. 
         This form of landscape can be seen in East Africa, the Vosges, the Basin and Range Province of Western North America and the Rhine valley.
         These areas often occur when the regional stress is extensional and the crust is thinned.</p>
